Below we have listed certain assumptions we have taken while designing our website:

1. We have designed our website according to the screen size 1920px*1080px, so we assume that for this phase the user is viewing it on the system of the same screen size.

2. The two logos we have inserted i.e iShapers in footer and MeloVibz in navigation bar are without any background as modified by us using photo editor tools. 

3. The top songs in the home page are linked to the album containing the song to enable the user to listen to the song directly.

4. About the footer, we assumed it should appear directly at the bottom of the page and not remain consistent like the navigation bar. Thus, our footer appears at bottom of page.

5. All the images used in creating the website have been uploaded in a seperate directory named as Images (it contains 191 images) along with the codes. In the codes we have given the path to images as the url.
(for example - Images/<image_name>)

6. All the html files are linked to a single css file for all the styling purpose.

7. Additional Designing (if any) using javascript may be added in future phases when we will be allowed to use javascript.

8. Along with all the codes and the images used in creating this Website, we have uploded a video (i.e, it contains the video of all our webpages as they were looking on our system), so please go through the same in case of any disperancies.

// PHASE_2 ASSUMPTIONS

1. The typing effects(Task 2) has been applied on the About Page.
2. In the Search page, after the Search button is clicked, the result takes approximately 30s to load and reflect on the page.
3.  The audio clips on the search page are only 30s long(probably due to access and priviledge restrictions).
4. For implementation of requests(like searching/applying filters), the user must click on corresponding buttons and not press Enter.
5. There is a single ‘Go’ button to apply both filters either simultaneously or any one of them.
6. Clearing the filters will reload the original 10 results(results without any filter).
7. On applying filters, it will filter the 10 results already displayed on the page and not reload top 10 from website according to filter. So after applying filter the number of results will be <=10.
8. The zoom in/zoom out effect on Spotlight page appears immediately on loading the page (not on hovering as directed by the mail).
9. Our website can display at max 3 reviews if submitted back to back without reloading the page. This is due to the design and layout of our page and not due to coding constraints (i.e the 4th review will appear but it is merging with the background color which is also black).
10. The Songs and Albums pages do not have any active link as they do not directly lie under either Artists/Home/Artist Spotlight/Search/About Pages.

// PHASE_3 ASSUMPTIONS 

1. 1. When a song is added to the playlist, the user is directed to the playlist page with a pop-up message saying “Song Added” displayed.
2. In case the user tries to add the same song twice, he is directed to playlist page with a pop-up message saying “Song already exists in playlist”.
3. On clicking the remove button the songs gets deleted from the playlist with a message saying “Song removed”.
